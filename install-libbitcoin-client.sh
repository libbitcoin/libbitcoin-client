# Script to build and install Libbitcoin Client and unpackaged dependencies.
#
# This build script is based on a few ideas.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  0. Start Clean: make reliable by never building from cached results.
#  1. Fail Fast: make all errors fail the build so that none are overlooked.
#  3. Self-Contain: build everything that needs to be built from one file.
#  2. Validate Dependencies: detect dependency breaks before they ship.
#  3. Validate Deployment: this file is both deployment and verification build.
#  3. Be Declarative: make behavior obvious by not using conditional statements.
#  4. Be Explicit: not everyone speaks the same code or human languages.
#  5. Use Least Privilege: don't require sudo for the entire script.
#  6. Do Not Repeat Yourself: do not repeat yourself.

# This script will build libbitcoin using this relative directory.
# This is meant to be temporary, just to facilitate the install.
